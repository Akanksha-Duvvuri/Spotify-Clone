# Spotify-Clone
Replicated SPOTIFY homepage by using HTML / CSS

Intro: A front-end only SPOTIFY clone homepage using only HTML5 and Vanilla CSS.

Used flexbox and other features to make it as close to the actual website as possible. Contains a sidebar, sticky top menu bar, main content with cards and a footer showing details of the song.

Tech: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, variables), icons via font-awesome

Interactions (CSS-only): Hover/focus states, smooth transitions, and overflow for long titles.

Limitations: No JS or backendâ€”this is a static UI prototype.
